    <h1>My Learning Journey</h1>
    <p>Throughout my time at Purdue, I developed myself a lot outside of the classroom. I give most of the credit to my career success (and failures) to the skills I've fostered outside of the class. I'm grateful to my physics professors and the department for not making the degree an easy one to obtain. I've sat next to geniuses and students far smarter than I. It was a humbling experience to be alongside so many smart people.</p>
    <p>Now, I've finished and I want to continue developing my skills. One of these skills is my programming skills. This blog is my first project through The Odin Project and I'm excited to show it off. Enjoy!</p>
